# AsteroidsvsEARTH

This is a game where you use your smarthphone/tablet accelerometer to move the ball sideways, tap&hold to move forwards.
The objective is to hit the center piece of the enemy while avoiding damaging obstacles.
If you hit the sides of the enemy and he doesn't turn blue you're receiving damage. Getting pushed out of the screen also ends in game over.
As of this build the enemy and you have 10 life points.
